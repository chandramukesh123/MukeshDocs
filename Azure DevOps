Build a Java application using maven and War deployment on Azure VM using Azure DevOps pipeline:

Pre requisites are Azure DevOps account, Azure cloud account to create window vm

Need to create one windows vm in azure cloud

we need to make this vm as a self hosted windows agent then only our pipeline will execute in this vm

For this, go through this link https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-windows?view=azure-devops or Azure DevOps pipeline tutorial in DevOps mela

After configuring self hosted agent, we need to see the agent is online or not, If it is online it is working otherwise it is not

Check the capabilities of the agent, Need to add capabilites which we need Ex: Maven

Install Java, Maven and Application server(Jboss) in the windows vm and configure environmental variables of Java and Maven

In Azure DevOps, create a project and create a pipeline

In pipeline, we need to configure repo which is having java code and build tool to build the code then automatically pipeline script will come

Run the Pipeline, If any errors, troubleshoot till the pipeline works
